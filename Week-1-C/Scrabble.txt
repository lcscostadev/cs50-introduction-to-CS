we want to write a program that check 2 string user inputs and compares then to each other, the user who has more points depending of the points each letter represents, wins. it also can be a tie.

1 - we are going to create 2 functions the main who's gonna store the input, score and condition to see which player has more points.
2 - get the user input for both players to type a word
3 - store the word in a function that will compute if the letter is on the lower case alphabet or on the uppercase alphabet and check if it is a space or a punctuation.
4 - we store that function word passed to the main function in a score1 and score2 for our players, which player that has the bigger score wins.
5 - at the compute score function we first store the length of the word string in a 'n' variable.
6 - we need to create a score variable to sum points depending on the letter the player chooses.
7 - we need a basic loop to iterate the 'n' AKA length of the word.
8 - inside the loop, we create a variable c to store each character of of the word.
9 - we create an if statement to check if c >= 'a' && c <= 'z', which means that we are inside the lowercase alphabet
10 - we will do the same thing for the uppercase alphabet.
11 - we sum score += POINTS[c - 'a']; -> we basically have our current character c that can be anything, lets say the letter 'd', so we subtract c to 'a' to get the index position of the 'd' letter
12 - we create an if statment that checkes if the current word is a punctuation or a space, if it is, we dont add any points to the user, so we return 0;
13 - we just return the score to use it in the main function.



CODE:

#include <ctype.h>
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

// Points assigned to each letter of the alphabet
int POINTS[] = {1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10};

int compute_score(string word);

int main(void)
{
    // Get input words from both players
    string word1 = get_string("Player 1: ");
    string word2 = get_string("Player 2: ");

    // Score both words
    int score1 = compute_score(word1);
    int score2 = compute_score(word2);

    // TODO: Print the winner
    if(score1 > score2) {
        printf("Player 1 won\n");
    } else if (score1 < score2) {
        printf("Player 2 won\n");
    } else {
        printf("Its a tie");
    }
}

int compute_score(string word)
{
    int n = strlen(word);
    int score = 0;
    // TODO: Compute and return score for string
    // we iterate through the word storing each letter in a variable c
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        char c = word[i];
        // checking if the letter is on the lowercase alphabet
        if(c >= 'a' && c <= 'z'){
            score += POINTS[c - 'a'];
        // checking if the letter is on the uppercase alphabet
        } else if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') {
            score += POINTS[c - 'A'];
        }

    // checking if the user types space or punctuation it doesnt earn points for that
        if(ispunct(word[i]) || isspace(word[i])) {
            return 0;
        }
    }
    return score;
}
