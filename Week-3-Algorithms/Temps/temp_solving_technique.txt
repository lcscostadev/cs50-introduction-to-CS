// Preps:
	1. Read the question.
	2. Read the code.

// Goal:
	sort 
		the average 
		high temperature values 
	for 10 cities in 
		decending order:

// Parameters (input):
	No inputs for this one.

// Results (output): 
	The program prints the average temperature of 10 cities in descending order based on temperature.

// Examples (what they want to come out of the problem):
	Average July Temperatures by City:

	Phoenix: 107
	Las Vegas: 105
	Austin: 97
	Miami: 97
	Denver: 90
	Chicago: 85
	New York: 85
	Boston: 82
	Los Angeles: 82
	San Francisco: 66

// Pseudocode (Talking about how this might be solve):
	Declare a struct "avg_temp" with two members, "city" and "temp".
	Declare an array "temps" of "avg_temp" struct type with a size of 10.
	Assign the city and temperature values of 10 different cities to the "temps" array.
	Define a function "sort_cities()" to sort the "temps" array in descending order based on temperature.
	Inside the "sort_cities()" function, use nested loops to compare the temperature of each city with the temperature of the next city in the array.
	If the temperature of the current city is less than the temperature of the next city, swap the positions of the two cities in the array.
	Print the sorted list of cities and their temperatures in descending order.
